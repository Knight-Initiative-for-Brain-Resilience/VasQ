# üß¨ About VasQ

**VasQ** is a custom AI-powered chat system designed to support complex biomedical reasoning, particularly around vascular biology and drug delivery in the human brain. It builds on the GPT-4 API and integrates three primary data sources:

- **Vascular snRNA-seq dataset**: Region- and cell type‚Äìspecific gene expression data derived from a human vascular single-nucleus RNA-seq atlas, processed using *Cell2Sentence*.
- **SPOKE knowledge graph (KG-RAG)**: A biomedical knowledge graph of curated biological relationships (genes, proteins, drugs, diseases, etc.), used via a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to inject structured context into GPT-4.
- **Google Custom Search**: Live web search to retrieve up-to-date biomedical information from the broader internet.

These components work together to support **multi-hop investigations** across gene expression, disease associations, and pharmacological mechanisms. For example, users can query transporters enriched in disease-relevant brain regions and trace their roles in blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport and drug uptake.

Key capabilities include:

- **Natural language querying** of transcriptomic data across 17 vascular cell types and 41 brain regions.
- **Dynamic knowledge graph retrieval** to surface disease and mechanism-related insights from SPOKE.
- **Web search integration** for real-time external references.
- **Zero training required** ‚Äî fully operational out of the box via API keys and Docker.

VasQ is ideal for generating hypotheses around **BBB-targeted therapeutics**, understanding **region-specific vascular biology**, and identifying **molecular pathways** for rational drug design.

# üôè Acknowledgements

This project builds on the work of several open-source efforts. In particular, we adapted and extended components from the following repositories:

- [**scChat**](https://github.com/li-group/scChat): A chat-based system for querying single-cell RNA-seq datasets, which provided the foundational architecture for VasQ's interface and agent design.
- [**KG-RAG**](https://github.com/BaranziniLab/KG_RAG): A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for biomedical knowledge graphs, which informed the implementation of VasQ's knowledge graph querying module using SPOKE.

We are grateful to the developers of these projects for their contributions to the open-source community.
