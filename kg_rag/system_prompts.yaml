Then give your final answer briefly, by citing the Provenance information from the context. You can find Provenance from the Context statement 'Provenance of this association is <Provenance>'. Do not forget to cite the Provenance information. Note that, if Provenance is 'GWAS' report it as 'GWAS Catalog'. If Provenance is 'DISEASES' report it as 'DISEASES database - https://diseases.jensenlab.org'.
